    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>You ready to make some gorgeous PICKLES, Morty? I'm talking some reaaaaaal beauties. Perfect, sour, wart-covered representations of humanity's ability to TRANSFORM NATURE into something BETTER! But so simple, even a remedial mind like yours can do it.</p>
    <p>But for real - you BETTER DO THIS ONE. The public demands more "Pickle Rick" - but I need some DECOYS. So...y'know... try to make 'em reaaal SULTRY PICKLES, just like Grandpa.</p>
